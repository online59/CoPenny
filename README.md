# CoPenny Expense Tracker

CoPenny is an Expense Tracker application designed to help users manage their finances by tracking expenses and incomes. It serves as a tool for individuals and families to monitor their spending habits and financial activities.

## Purpose

This project serves as a test project for exploring concepts related to NoSQL databases and making API requests. It aims to provide a hands-on learning experience in building applications that involve data storage and retrieval, as well as interacting with external services through APIs.

## Current Status

As of now, CoPenny is still a work in progress. While the basic functionality of tracking expenses and managing incomes is available, there are plans to introduce additional features to enhance its usability and usefulness.
