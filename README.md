# CoPenny Expense Tracker

CoPenny is an Expense Tracker application designed to help users manage their finances by tracking expenses and incomes. It serves as a tool for individuals and families to monitor their spending habits and financial activities.

## Purpose

This project serves as a test project for exploring concepts related to NoSQL databases and making API requests. It aims to provide a hands-on learning experience in building applications that involve data storage and retrieval, as well as interacting with external services through APIs.

## Current Status

As of now, CoPenny is still a work in progress. While the basic functionality of tracking expenses and managing incomes is available, there are plans to introduce additional features to enhance its usability and usefulness.

## Planned Features

In the future, the following features are planned to be implemented:

- **Wallet Management**: Users will be able to create multiple wallets to categorize their expenses and incomes effectively.
- **Family Sharing**: Users can add family members to the same wallet, enabling shared expense tracking and collaborative financial management among family members.
- **Expense Tracking Across Credit Cards**: CoPenny may include functionality to track expenses across different credit cards, providing a comprehensive overview of spending patterns.
